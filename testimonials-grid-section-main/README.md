## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
ONLY CREATED TO BE VIEWED ON DESKTOP.

### Screenshot

Add a screenshot of your solution. The easiest way to do this is to use Firefox to view your project, right-click the page and select "Take a Screenshot". You can choose either a full-height screenshot or a cropped one based on how long the page is. If it's very long, it might be best to crop it.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid

### What I learned

This challenege really help me to practice the use of grid and also flexbox. I also learnt to take some time, really understand what is potentially happening in the design and where I can possible write class to cover identicle areas of the same design throughout the page.

### Continued development

I want to further understand the tools, flexbox and grid. Then really start to attack responsive design, having code that works they way I intend on all devices.
